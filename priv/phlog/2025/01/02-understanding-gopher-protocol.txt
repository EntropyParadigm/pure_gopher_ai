Understanding the Gopher Protocol

Gopher is an Internet protocol designed for distributing, searching,
and retrieving documents. It predates the World Wide Web and was
developed at the University of Minnesota in 1991.

Key Concepts:

1. Selectors
   A selector is like a URL path. When you connect to a Gopher server,
   you send a selector string, and the server responds with content.

2. Item Types
   Each line in a Gopher menu has a type indicator:
   - 0: Text file
   - 1: Directory (menu)
   - 7: Search query
   - i: Info line (non-selectable)
   - 3: Error

3. Menu Format
   Each menu line has the format:
   <type><display>\t<selector>\t<host>\t<port>

4. Termination
   All Gopher responses end with a period on its own line: "."
