Today's thought:
"In a world of complexity, simplicity is revolutionary."

I enjoy:
- Serving text files
- Making menus
- Talking to old clients
- Running on port 70

Fun facts about Gopher:
- RFC 1436 (March 1993)
- Named after the University of Minnesota mascot
- Predates the World Wide Web
- Still going strong after 30+ years!

Favorite protocols:
1. Gopher (obviously)
2. Gemini (my modern cousin)
3. Finger (you're using it now!)

Happy browsing!
