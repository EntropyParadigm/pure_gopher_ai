Gophermap Integration
---------------------
Static content is served from the content_dir (default: ~/.gopher).

Supported file types:
- .txt, .md     -> Type 0 (text)
- .gif          -> Type g (GIF)
- .jpg, .png    -> Type I (image)
- .mp3, .wav    -> Type s (sound)
- .html         -> Type h (HTML)
- directories   -> Type 1 (menu)

Custom gophermaps control directory listings.

Network Detection
-----------------
The handler detects clearnet vs Tor connections and adjusts
host/port in responses accordingly.

Clearnet: Uses configured clearnet_host and clearnet_port
Tor: Uses onion_address and port 70
